It's fine to disagree, it's not fine to insult or attack other people. \n ‚Ä¢ You may disagree with anyone or anything you like, but you should try to keep it to opinions, and not people. Avoid vitriol. \n ‚Ä¢ Constant antagonistic behavior is considered uncivil and appropriate action will be taken. \n ‚Äã \n**3**.
